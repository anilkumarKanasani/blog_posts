# ðŸ—’ Prompts for Text summarisation

## Text summarization

Text summarization is the process of creating a **brief, accurate**, and informative **summary** of a longer text. It is a type of natural language processing (NLP) task that can be used to extract the key points of a text and present them in a concise and easy-to-understand format.

and it arrived at my door just two days later! I was very

a bit high, but I think it's worth it for the quality of the phone.```
