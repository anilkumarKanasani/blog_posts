<mark style="color:red;">**Entropy**</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">**State**</mark> ( solid/liquid/gas ) of any system is measured by entropy. ( like temperate value for heat )

If a system absorbs a quantity of heat <mark style="background-color:blue;">**Î”Q**</mark> at absolute temperature <mark style="background-color:green;">**T**</mark>, then the change in the state of the system is measured by <mark style="color:red;">**Entropy**</mark>.

**Change in entropy** is positive when the heat is added

It is an indicator (or) represent value of a given distribution. Like Simple Moving Average ( SMA ), EMA is simply average price of data in a given time interval, but it is giving more weightage to near to latest data. In SMA, all the data is same.
