# Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
**Acknowledgement :**&#x20;

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my instructors,  [Mike Chambers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAOBotwBjlI40oiyebPckX9cPG5K31TmJKc), [Antje Barth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABl81U8BtWmVIZW5HeJ5XorSpuvUZjm\_Yyw), [Shelbee Eigenbrode](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAALlJFoBAOFBo-DGHYJ08UR9THOOaSOo-HE), [Chris Fregly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAABTnPcBMVZJE2bhAShwKzrLwwUqN\_nIjFs) from [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon-web-services/) and [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/) from [DeepLearning AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/), for their guidance and support in helping me to learn about large language models. I gained most of the knowledge to write this blog post from their lectures and tutorials.

I would also like to thank the [Bard tool ](https://bard.google.com/)for generating the text for this blog post. I am grateful for the opportunity to use Bard and to learn about large language models.



I hope this blog post is informative and helpful.
